BLuau was released on February 22, 2025, almost a year ago. It was the beginning of a large-scale project within BlockGuard SF. Although its lack of popularity was a drawback, it allowed us to better understand what we wanted and how to implement it.

While we were already well advanced in development, we didn't like the direction BLuau was taking in its way of functioning and how it managed each package. Many mistakes were made, and that's why we decided to start from scratch with a new name, RbxPI.

**That is why, since March 11, 2025, after only 2 months, BLuau has reached its end of life. As a result, it has not received any updates or bug fixes since that date.**

::: caution

We strongly advise against continuing to use BLuau.

:::

## Standard Library

The BLuau standard library is no longer being updated either. If you think you can use a package from RbxPI in BLuau, that is not possible. Unless modified, packages developed for the RbxPI standard library are not compatible with BLuau.

## What is the Next Step

If you decide to switch from BLuau to RbxPI, you can expect several changes:

* **Performance improvements** with better-managed package loading.
* Much more **extensive and explanatory documentation**.
* A **new package format**.
* **Better support** for third-party tools.
* And much more...
